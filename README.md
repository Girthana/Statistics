# Statistics
1. Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.
  Constraints: 10<=N<2500, 0<x[i]<10^5
2. Compute Weighted Mean of X elements
3. Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3). The quartiles need to be integers.
